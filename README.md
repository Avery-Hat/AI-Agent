# AI Agent for Boot.dev
Currently I've completed Chapters 1 - 2, and started on Chapter 3 at the end of the day.
As of now the bot can be ran with " uv run main.py "example question goes here""

requires your own google gemini key that goes into a .env file on the main directory.
formatting in that file looks like: 

GEMINI_API_KEY="abc123"

will update for further information once this project is completed or another EOD update.
